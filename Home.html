                Sea turtles are ancient mariners. Present in all but Earth's coldest oceans, these marine reptiles are well adapted to a life on the move. Sea turtles have existed since the time of the dinosaurs. The earliest known marine turtle lived about 120 million years ago. Named Desmatochelys padillai, it was 6ft(1.8m) long and had the characteristic features of modern sea turtles, including a carapace, or top shell, and paddle like limbs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Today, there are 7 species of sea turtles,namely<b>Green turtle,Hawksbill turtle,Loggerhead turtle, Olive Ridley turtle, Kemp's Ridley sea turtle, Flatback sea turtle </b>and with the largest being the <b>Leatherback turtle.</b> Growing as long as 8ft(2.4m) and weighing upto 2000 pounds, it is larger than known fossils of its prehistoric ancestor, Desmatochelys padillai.

            <h1>Turtle Population in the world</h1>
            <p>Total population figures are often unknown because juvenile and male sea turtles do not come ashore and are difficult to count.</p>
            <p>Population data are usually based on the numbers of adult females that come ashore to nest. Even then, the numbers are ambiguous because some females nest every two to three years; some may nest more than once on the same beach in a season; and some visit more than one nesting beach in a season.</p>
            <p>Researchers rely on the changing numbers of nesting females from year to year to determine population trends. Because broad year-to-year fluctuations in numbers of nesting females make short-term data misleading, surveys of a decade or less may be insufficient to determine a population trend</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kemp’s ridley sea turtle</li>
                <p>In 1942, the nesting population at Rancho Nuevo, the only nesting area for the species, was estimated at about 42,000 Kemp’s ridleys. After rapidly declining to a low of less than 300 nesting females by 1986, the Kemp’s ridley population is now estimated at 5,000 adult females in the Gulf of Mexico</p>
                <li>Green sea turtles</li>
                <p>Experts estimate that in the past 120 to 140 years green sea turtle numbers have declined by 48 to 67 percent.The largest green turtle nesting population is found at Tortuguero, on the coast of Costa Rica where about 22,500 green turtle females nest annually.The second largest nesting population is found at Raine Island, on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef,about 18,000 females per season and between 200 and 1,100 green sea turtles nest on beaches in the continental U.S.</p>
                <li>Hawksbill sea turtle nesting population</li>
                <p>Hawksbill nests are often obscured by beach vegetation and their tracks do not last long in the sand. The largest hawksbill nesting population is in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, where about 6,000 to 8,000 females nest each year.</p>
                <li>loggerhead sea turtle nesting population</li>
                <p>Nearly all loggerhead nesting populations are declining. The worldwide population is unknown.Only Florida and Oman have nesting loggerhead populations of greater than 10,000; with about 20,000 nesting females in Florida and 13,000 in Oman.In the U.S., total estimates for loggerhead nests per year range from 68,000 to 90,000.In the Pacific, about 1,200 loggerheads nest in Japan and eastern Australia. </p>
                <li> olive ridley sea turtle nesting population</li>
                <p>Each year, there are probably about 500,000 to 600,000 females nesting in arribadas (mass nesting sites) in Costa Rica, 450,000 in Mexico and about 135,000 in India; with a total female population of about 2 million turtles. Yet, many of their populations are declining or have disappeared, mainly from egg poaching and accidental death in fishing gear.
                </p>
                <li>flatbacks sea turtle nesting population</li>
                <p>Scientists estimate that 25,000 to 30,000 mature female flatbacks inhabit Australian waters. Because of its limited distribution, the flatback is the most vulnerable of all sea turtles to habitat change or exploitation.</p>
                <li> leatherback sea turtle nesting population</li>
                <p>Worldwide leatherback populations are not known.Populations of more than 1,000 leatherback sea turtles nest in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Western Pacific.In the United States, about 40 leatherbacks nest annually on beaches in Florida.Many of the nesting leatherback populations in the Pacific have declined by more than 80%.Trends are unclear for many other nesting populations, although they seem to be increasing at nesting beaches in the U.S. and at some Caribbean nesting sites.</p>

            <h1>Where can we see turtles in Sri Lanka?</h1>
                <p>Turtle watching is an amazing experience beyond explanation. Watching these calm and peaceful critters in the sea, slowly swimming, looking for their next meal, or hauling themselves up to a sandy beach for nesting - is something that is bound to be in your memory for a long time.</p><p>Depending on the season, <b>Rekawa, Hikkaduwa, Mirissa, Kosgoda, Beruwala and Trincomalee </b>can be considered as the best places in the island to catch a glimpse of these great turtles… or maybe have a swim with them, if you get lucky.</p>

        <div class="secitem7">
            <h1>Why are sea turtles in Sri Lanka endangered?</h1>
                <p>Despite its natural predators, humans are the biggest threat to the sea turtle in Sri Lanka. Under Sri Lanka’s Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, it is prohibited to kill, wound, or harm a turtle. Furthermore, turtle possession or sale, as well as taking or destroying turtle eggs is a federal offense. Unfortunately, activities harming these marine dwellers continue</p>

                <h1>What can we do to save the sea turtles in Sri Lanka</h1>
                <!-- A bullet point list -->
                <ul> 
                    <li>Reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles.</li>
                    <li>Participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean. The trash in the ocean can harm sea turtles and other creatures that live there.</li>
                    <li>Carry reusable water bottles and shopping bags. Refrain from releasing balloons, they'll likely end up in the ocean where sea turtles can mistake them for prey and consume them.</li>
                    <li>Keep nesting beaches dark and safe for sea turtles. Turn off, shield, or redirect lights visible from the beach. Lights disorient hatchling sea turtles and discourage nesting females from coming onto the beach to lay their eggs.</li>
                    <li>Do not disturb nesting turtles, nests, or hatchlings. Attend organised sea turtle watches that know how to safely observe nesting sea turtles.</li>
                    <li>Remove recreational beach equipment like chairs, umbrellas, boats at night - so that sea turtles are not turned away.
                    <li>Fill in holes and knockdown sandcastles before you leave the beach. They can become obstacles for nesting turtles or emerging hatchlings.</li>
                </ul>
